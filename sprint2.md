* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 
* The team lead can add their sprint overveiw file directly to master as long as that is the ONLY FILE EDITED to facilitate updates to said file


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.
*#71 The calculator data shouldn't go away when units change
*#75 The calculator needs to display an error if there is bad latitude/longitude
*#84 I may need distances in other units of measure
*#21 Show where the user is on the map
*#81 Show map and Itinerary for trip
*#83 Enter latitudes and longitudes in the calculator using degree-minute-second and other formats.
*#82 The calculator data shouldn't go away when units change.

We have agreed to break down some of the smaller epics #83, #82,#75,#84 into tasks for individual members of the team to complete. Some of the larger epics, #81 in particular, will be team efforts and will be broken down into tasks as they are moved out of the backlog.
We will also try to meet 4 times a week. MWF immediately after class and Saturday for a more lengthy session.
Key planning decisions for this sprint include ...
