# Sprint 1 - *t11* - *Ultra Super Team Delta*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *Edward Pike*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (team/sprint#.md).

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* Someone else approves and merges commits, you may not merge your own changes.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#7  TripCo: The application should identify the client and server currently in use*
* *#8  TripCo: Use a standard logging system on the server*
* *#4  User: I'd like to know who to thank for this tool*
* *#5  User: I want to compute the distance between two locations on the planet*
* *#6  User: I may need distances in other units of measure*
* *#16 User: I want to know where I am on the map*
* *#71 User: Calculator should not reset when options is clicked*
* *#75 User: Calculator needs to display an error if there is bad latitude/longitude*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *#16 User: I want to know where I am on the map*: Insufficiant knowledge/experience working with react javaScript
* *#71 User: Calculator should not reset when options is clicked*: Insufficiant knowledge/experience working with react javaScript
* *#75 User: Calculator needs to display an error if there is bad latitude/longitude*: Insufficiant knowledge/experience working with react javaScript

#### What went well
* *When someone encountered an error/problem (be it on client or server side) more than one person in the group went in and helped find solutions and workarounds*
* *Everyone got pretty familiar with the structure of the client/server layout for the software.  I think we're all pretty comfortable with either knowing where something is or being able to find it if we didn't originally know.*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *It has been a while since some of us (maybe all of us) have used java so getting used to basic java syntax and style added a little bit of time to development. It really just took some playing around to get used to java conventions again*
* *None of us had any real experience using javascript so using that has been slightly painful thus far.  Again, with some playing around and web searches most problems went away.*

## Retrospective

#### What went well
* *All group members showed up for meetings unless unable with good reason*
* *We started early and seem to work well as a group/generally get along*

#### Potential improvements
* *We started early and got a lot done early but trickled off, I think we need to stay more consistent with work/production*
* *We need to get better at dividing up the work so every has tasks that are about equal in length - this will come as we have more experience*

#### What we will change next time
* *With more to do I think we will be able to stay active and continuously working so that should mitigate any falling off we encountered in the first sprint because of the relatively small workload.*
* *We will have more clearly defined roles of who is assigned to what task/job.*
