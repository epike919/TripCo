# Teamwork Questionnaire for _yournamehere_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text or GroupMe, pretty much any hour after 9AM. I have my phone on me at all times and am somewhat of a nightowl.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * We're all going to learn a lot of skills, with different software packages, coding conventions and what it takes to code in a team.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Staying on top of assignments (i.e. starting early and working at least a little every day) and trying to set up at least a weekly group meeting, hopefully more than once a week (who has class after 4 MWF anyhow?)
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Everyone has different goals, maybe someone else wants to work on a particular aspect of the project that you would also like to work on. Essentially we just have to take turns on stuff if that is the case or potentially we could work together in twos on the same problem.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Well it seems like everyone's grade is dependant on their own work. Obviously anyone who wants an "A" is going to go above and beyond, perhaps they could tackle some of the more intensive problems while making sure people who are fine with a "B" at least pull their weight.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Yes; so long as they don't adapt a lone wolf approach and try to do everything on their own so that the other group members still have tasks to accomplish and new concepts to learn.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm hoping 6-9 hours as that is the guideline set by the university (3 credit class), but if I'm being honest about what I have heard from previous students it will probably be more like 10-15 hours.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Group consensus/taking turns. If you want to do something but so does someone else try switching off sprints. Same with things no one wants to do (i.e. anything javascript) If no one wants to do it ever, we should all take turns doing it and if someones mind changes or they come to find that they are good at it perhaps they would just want to take over.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * It will be clear ahead of time that someone is falling behind (as long as it is not a no show) so we will try to communicate with them about what the problem is and if that does not resolve it we will have to talk to TAs or the professor/manager.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We will have to find a compromise and work to a point where we are all happy.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Biweekly meetings will make it possible for us to check on everyone elses progress.  I'm hoping that meetings will really resolve any issues in this matter.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes; I believe we have all agreed to meeting after class Monday and Wednesday with supplemental meetings where necessary.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least 2 hours per week, but if we can manage to keep up our goal of 2 meetings per week I imagine we will easily surpass that.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes; complete agreement is more or less essential to a well functioning group.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We will discuss and try to see things from everyone's point of view, if there is still an impass we will have to bring in the big guns to hash it out.  Hopefully it won't have to come to that.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Well if you mean that they're telling everyone what to do and setting timelines for tasks to be completed I don't have a problem with someone taking that initiative as long as it is being done in a fair way.  If someone is just trying to do all the work on their own in a lone wolf esque style then we will have to talk to them about how we can all be involved.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Try to make that feeling heard by teammates before talking to somoene else about it.
