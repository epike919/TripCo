# Teamwork Questionnaire for _yournamehere_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is best to reach me by text at any hour, but I will also respond to emails, just not as fast.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect my team to work well together towards a final product worthy of an A.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I plan on improving my communication skills by constantly informing my team mates of what I'm doing and what I need, while also making sure to listen to their needs and activity. I also plan to improve my teamwork skills by putting the needs of the team above my own.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Schedule differences, work loads, and communication errors are all obstacles that I expect to encounter when trying to reach my team and personal goals.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * All members should discuss their goals and try to reach an agreement. If this does not happen, then the students who want and A should discuss what to do with the TA's or Dave before taking any actions. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If this involves fixing files that would have otherwised caused the team to get a "B," then I do think that the extra work is acceptable as long as the other team mates refuse to fix their mistakes.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * About 6 - 9 hours per week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we should decide this by considering personal skills, team needs, and personal wants on certain activities. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should be checking on each other as a team to make sure this doesn't happen, but if it does then we should have a *civil* discussion with that individual to make sure they don't do the same in the future, and take extra steps to further guarantee that it doesn't happen again.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We should have a discussion if this issue arrises and decide on a course of action from there, but I believe that higher quality work should always be the priority. If someone believes that the work could be better, then it could be better. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I don't think work habits matter as long as everyone is committing evenly to the project on the dates planned by our team. If something happens, then again I think we should have a discussion about moving forward. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, we already plan on meeting atleast two times a week for atleast an hour.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least two times a week. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think everyone should agree on a decision before it is made. If we cannot get a unanimous vote, then we should bring in a trusted outside mediator to help us solve the problem.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Refer to the above question. We will have to bring in an outside mediator so that "tyranny of the majority" does not happen.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Facilitate a discussion in where we ask them to do even work instead of dominating everything. If they refuse, then we should bring in one of the TAs in or Dave to make sure that everyone is getting their fair share of work.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Again, I would contact Dave or the TAs to help me solve this if discussion with my team mates fails to produce any results.
